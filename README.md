# Nimiq Documentation Theme

## Motivation
For the [Nimiq Blockchain](https://nimiq.com) we wanted to design a documentation theme which has the following properties:

- is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages; one-click installation
- works with multiple `.md` files
- automatically generates table of contents from filenames and headings
- clean design focused on the content and its typography
- mobile layout
- works without javascript

## Usage

1. Fork this repository
1. In `_config.yml` replace `title`, `description` and `baseUrl`  
1. Replace `README.md` and all `.md` files in `chapters` with your content
1. Publish your documentation
