# Nimiq Documentation Theme

## Motivation
For the [Nimiq Blockchain](https://nimiq.com) we wanted to design a documentation theme which has the following properties:

- is a Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages; one-click installation
- works with multiple `.md` files
- automatically generates table of contents from filenames and headings
- clean design focused on the content and its typography
- mobile layout
- works without javascript

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "doc-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: doc-theme
```
