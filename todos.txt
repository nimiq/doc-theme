- Must Have
	- Navigation
#		- fixed 100% height
#		- scrolls internally -- flex box: header is now fixed 20%. possible to have it auto height?
		- accordeon
#		- should never switch order of items + sort pages by depth in tree
	- Structure
		- how to with submodule?
		- what's the deepest crawling depth? use excludes: '*/*/**' in _config.yml
		- if a subfolder doesn't contain a readme about its own subfolders, automatically generate an index.html from the `h1` and descriptions of its subfolders
			- see /elements
