#- Must Have
#	- Navigation
#		- fixed 100% height
#		- scrolls internally -- flex box: header is now fixed 20%. possible to have it auto height?
#		- accordeon
#		- should never switch order of items + sort pages by depth in tree
	- Structure
#		- how to with submodule?
#		- what's the deepest crawling depth? use excludes: '*/*/**' in _config.yml
?		- if a subfolder doesn't contain a readme about its own subfolders, automatically generate an index.html from the `h1` and descriptions of its subfolders
			- see /elements > currently: h1 and h2 of subfolders are indexed and shown in nav

- Nice To Have
#	- Search
#	- Title in header on mobile
?	- demos > like submodules? demos for root and for each submodule?
